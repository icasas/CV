# Hello! I'm Isabel Casas 👋

Welcome to my CV page!

When someone asks me what I do for a living, I say: *"I try to understand uncertainty"*. Soon they realize I'm a **numbers** person who likes **solving problems**.

I also get on very well with **computers** 🤖 — you just have to talk to them precisely, and once you do, they'll happily do everything you ask.

- Although my career has been mostly academic since starting my PhD in Statistics in 2002, I also have experience in industry. 

- My work in econometrics and time series has often gone beyond theory, focusing on applications like **forecasting energy production** or **developing models and tools for applied decision making**.  

- I’m curious, adaptable, and motivated by projects that create an impact.  

🌍 Based in Bilbao, Spain  
📊 Open to industry opportunities
